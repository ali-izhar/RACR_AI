# This file is used to store information about the devices that have been
# configured for use with experiments. In the near future, there will be no
# need to edit this file manually.
#
# Each device has:
#   1. a unique nickname (the top-level keys in this file)
#   2. one of the supported device types
#   3. a list of connection parameters, each of which has:
#       a. a hostname or IP address (host)
#       b. a username (user)
#       c. a path to a private key file, which should be stored in the
#          "pkeys" directory under "AppData" (pkey_fp) *
#       d. a boolean indicating whether this is the default connection
#          parameter for this device (default) **
#
#  * The path is used within the docker container, so it shouldn't be changed
#    to an actual path on the host machine. See the volume mapping in run.sh
#    if this doesn't make sense.
# ** There may be multiple connection parameters for a device if, for instance,
#    the device is accessible from the local network and from the internet; or
#    if there are different users for the same device.
#
# To find IP address of current device (localhost):
# hostname -I | awk '{print $1}'
#
# To connect Jetson via USB serial:
#   - Connect Jetson to Laptop via USB cable
#   - On Laptop, Device Manager / Ports (COM & LPT) / COM#
#   - PuTTy connect via Serial -> Speed = 115200
#   - Authenticate and connect to Jetson
#   - hostname -I | awk '{print $1}' -> 123.456.7.890
#   - nmcli r wifi on
#   - nmcli d wifi list     # SSID is the WiFi name
#   - sudo nmcli dev wifi con "SSID" password "WiFiPassword"
#   - ssh racr@123.456.7.890
#
# The pkey_fp below are set in the dockerfiles
# The top-level names (localhost, racr) need to match exactly as defined in alexnetsplit.yaml
